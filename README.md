# file-converter
Part of my studies towards #awesome do it all goat, anyways fun little website that im working on to convert files :) Fun learning how to implemetnt the single page app and cool animations and stuff :3 

python3 -m http.server to locally host it 

#### Goals:

[ ] Actually work and convert duh  
[ ] Host it either on private server or public domain for the world to observe  
[ ] Responsive design for compatibility across screens  
[ ] Optimisations, all kinds => memory, performance, rendering   
[ ] I always struggled with frontend, I want to level up my UI/UX skills with this one, even if it doesn't meet professional fluent designs or in demand standards. I want something I like that, that is well thought out and pretty  
[ ] Customisable options for settings tab, for example custom file naming format for each conversion  
[ ] Bulk conversion  
[ ] Option export as zip for bulk
